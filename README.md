### Functional Specification for Visual Components:
#### üìå Website Logo
The website should have a logo either in a separate frame or as part of a frame that also contains other elements.
#### üìå Category Hierarchy
1. Initially, a separate frame should show only the top-level categories of items available in the shop.
2. When the mouse moves over or clicks a particular category node, the node expands to show the second-level categories of items.
3. Whenever a second-level category is clicked, it shows a list of items in the category in the main information area (most likely in a different frame).
#### üìå Main Information Area
1. Initially, the main information area (i.e., a separate frame) should show a collection of items. Each item has an image and an Add button beside it. User can click the button to add the item to the shopping cart only when the item is ‚Äúin stock‚Äù.
2. When a customer clicks on a particular item, a new page (most likely in a different frame) or a popup window shows more details about that item, where the customer can still add the item to the shopping cart.
#### üìå Search Box
1. There should be a search box (either in the main information area or a separate frame) that customers can use to look for items by name, or filter items by price (or price range).
2. The search results will show in the main information area.
#### üìå Shopping Cart
1. There should be separate frame or pop-up window showing the content of a virtual shopping cart. Customers may use a scroll bar if there are too many items to show in the shopping cart.
2. The shopping cart shows not only the items inside the cart but also the number and total price of the items in the cart.
3. Customers can clear the shopping cart by clicking on a Clear button on the shopping cart page.
4. Customers can also complete their shopping by clicking a Checkout button on the shopping cart page.
5. The Checkout button should be in grey color and non-clickable when the shopping cart is empty.
6. Once the Checkout button is clicked, an online order form shows up (either on the same page or on a new page), requesting the customer to fill in delivery details (name, address, suburb, state, country, phone number) and email address.
7. A customer can click the Place Order button to place the order. Note that all the fields in the form must be completed before an order can be placed successfully.
8. Once an order is placed successfully, a confirmation email will be sent to the customer‚Äôs email address, with the order and deliver details attached.
